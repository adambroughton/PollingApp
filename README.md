**Issue with POST request onSubmit of poll creation**

Welcome to my polling app! 

This is now live at: http://www.adambroughton.co.uk/


Please see the project plan & powerpoint listed as: Polling_App_Project_Plan_&_PowerPoint.zip


At this current moment in time, all user can log into a dev account which is SHARED - so please take care when adding polls. 

I plan to change this once the app has more features like:
* Links to individual polls
* Poll vote refresh on backend
* Delete poll button
* Poll analytics on the dashboard
* Poll creation form to have dynamic options
* And many more...
  

List of technologies used:
* React
* Next.js
* Node.js
* Tailwindcss
* TypeScript
* C#
* Microsoft DOTNET
* SQLite3
* AWS
